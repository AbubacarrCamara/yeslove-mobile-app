        content: `Today is #WorldBipolarDay and Mother’s Day - a time to celebrate mothers and acknowledge those navigating the challenges of bipolar disorder, whether personally or as a supportive loved one.

If you love someone with bipolar, you’ve probably struggled with what to say (or not say) during their highs and lows.

Here’s the thing: Some words, even if well-intended, can do more harm than good. Let’s break it down. 👇

1. “You were fine yesterday. What’s wrong now?”

→ Bipolar isn’t predictable, and expecting consistency can make them feel misunderstood.

✔️ You could try: “I know things can change day by day. How can I support you right now?”

2. “You don’t look sick.”

→ Mental health conditions aren’t always visible, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t real.

✔️ You could try: “I may not see it, but I know it’s real for you. I’m here.”

3. “Maybe you just need to try harder.”

→ Bipolar disorder isn’t about effort—it’s a medical condition, not a mindset.

✔️ You could try: “I see how much you’re doing, and I appreciate your effort.”

4. “Just think positive!”

→ Positive thinking doesn’t override brain chemistry.

✔️ You could try: “I know this is hard, and you don’t have to go through it alone.”

5. “I don’t know how much more of this I can take.”

→ Your feelings are valid, but saying this can make them feel like a burden.

✔️ You could try: “This is tough, and I want to find ways for both of us to cope.”

💡 Navigating a relationship with bipolar disorder isn’t about having all the answers - it’s about listening, learning, and adapting.

Today, let’s go beyond awareness. Let’s get better at supporting the people we love.
